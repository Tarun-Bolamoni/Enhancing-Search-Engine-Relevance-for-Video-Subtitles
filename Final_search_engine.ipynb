company got an earful   and then  when i turned around  she was gone   oh  ross  yeah  i know   but  hey  in my defense  i just found out   that condoms are only  like  97  effective   what   i got to go find her   whoa  hey  hold on   are you serious   so  like  three percent of the time   they don t even work   huh  they should put that on the box   evidently  they do   what   well  i ll be   i

right leg  to be exact   look for yourself   you ll see   use the free code joinnow at  www playships eu   well  there was definitely nothing literal about my dream   but the guy in it he he was young   he was like 20  21  uh   oh  he had dark  shaggy hair   oh  he also had a  uh  a tattoo   on his arm   it was like an eight ball with fire all around it   i don t know what to tell you  allison   no one matching that description has been reported missing   or turned up dead   lee  can you hold on a second   i m getting another call  sorry   hello   hello  is this allison dubois   yes   this is mrs  desai from the ubient credit corporation   i m calling to inform you   that your account is more than 90 days past due   well  i appreciate your heads up  mrs  desai   but you know what we already know that   cause someone from your company has been nice enough   to call us every single day to remind us   now  if you can t arrange to make the minimum payment soon   i m afraid your credit cards are going to be frozen   yeah  you know what we know that  too   we want to pay you   we really do   and we will  as soon as we can   i m sorry  i have to get off now   cause i have another call   sorry about that  lee   uh  no problem  i ll keep an eye out  okay   thanks   so  you re fairly confident   that cassandra baldwin would make a good juror   she s perfect for you   i think that she will vote to acquit   sir   hmm   i m sorry  allison   the truth is  my mind isn t really   on this jury at the moment   um   actually  there s something else   i would like to discuss with you   i had dinner last night with an old colleague  jed garrity   he was a judge when i was a junior prosecutor   and he s served as a state senator for   more than a decade now   it was quite an interesting evening   apparently  there s some dissatisfaction   with the way tom van dyke is handling himself   as district attorney   imagine that   hmm   van dyke is up for reelection soon   there are some people who are disappointed   that he s running unopposed   senator garrity among them   last night  garrity asked me if i d be interested   in throwing my hat into the ring   so what did you say   oh  i told him that i was  uh  content   to languish in a rented office on the edge of downtown   i also told him that i   always imagined spending the autumn of my career   picking up cases on a catch as catch can basis   what do you think i said   i told him i m excited   i told him that i miss serving the city of phoenix   i  uh  that i d be thrilled to stand for the job   oh  that s great news   i m so happy for you   i have to admit   i m happy for me  too   but i m trying to keep it in check   this isn t going to be easy   the logistics of getting a campaign up and running   at this late date  frankly they re  daunting   and   the senator s support is conditional   before he s willing to endorse me   he has concerns that need to be addressed   and chief among them is you   hey  if it helps you get your job back   i will happily crawl under a rock   until after the election   well  i appreciate the offer   but i don t think that s a realistic possibility   reporters are quite good at looking under rocks   yeah   senator garrity would like to meet you   tonight  as a matter of fact   if you re willing  the three of us could have dinner   the senator could ask you his questions   and  hopefully that ll be that   dad  yeah   i need to call hannah back   and bridgette won t get off the phone   well  i m in the middle of something  ariel  just be patient   yeah  but she s been on the phone for  like  ten minutes   who s she talking to  i don t know   some weird guy  but she won t say when she ll be done   well  just hold on for a couple minutes  okay   i m sure she ll be off soon   really  you got to call somebody in niagara falls   how many times   bridgette  who are you talking to   can you hold on a second  please   mr  reshmi   have you ever talked to anybody in alaska   bridgette  who is mr  reshmi   he s the credit card man   you re talking to somebody from the credit card company   give me the phone   but we were in the middle of talking   mr  reshmi   hi   yeah  my name is joseph dubois   i wonder if your supervisor would be interested in learning   you spent the last ten minutes chatting with a nine year old   that s right  nine   well  all right   let me be really clear about something   i don t want you calling here again   i don t want you harassing my family   and if it continues   then i m going to call the authorities   good bye   a hiker s dog sniffed him out of a shallow grave   in boyce park this morning   somebody stabbed him a couple dozen times   then they dissected him with a chain saw   the best bet is your friend here died   somewhere close to midnight   that s the same tattoo from my dream   that s what i thought   now  what would really be helpful would be   if you could give me a complete description of this guy   a little something more than  uh   four feet tall  no arms  no legs  no head   you know  i could probably also give you the description   of the guy who did this to him   what are you talking about  you saw the murder   you never mentioned that   well  not exactly it wasn t realistic   but there was a man in the dream   who was definitely interested in his limbs   he wanted them   for food   hubba  hubba   a hubba from the hubba   well  that s good   but it s not too hubba  right   mm  why do you ask   mmm   well  devalos is too polite to say anything   but i m getting the feeling that this endorsement   hangs on whether or not this garrity guy   thinks i m a complete nut job   i want to look nice   but sane   well  you look very nice   very sane   but i do have to ask   are you sure that you are okay   with devalos campaigning for his old job   what are you talking about   well  campaigns mean publicity   and publicity means reporters   lots and lots of reporters   asking questions writing things about you   it wasn t exactly a party the first time around   well  i don t feel like i have a choice   and devalos isn t asking for my permission to run for office   he s asking for my help   i know he s not thrilled with what he s doing right now   and i feel partially responsible for that   i d really like to help him get back the one job in the world   that makes him truly happy   hey   allison   you look lovely   thank you   jed   the secret ingredient   is you   allison dubois   i d like you to meet senator jed garrity   hey  hi   are the girls in bed   oh  ariel s doing homework   but bridgette and marie are asleep   how d dinner go  oh   i passed muster with the senator   he s going to endorse devalos   they re scheduling a press conference for friday   oh  so that s a win  right   yeah  it s great   i even managed to get through the meal   without accusing garrity of murder   you know  i spent the whole afternoon   with a police sketch artist   giving him a perfect description   of an arizona state senator   what if they distribute that sketch   who are you calling   scanlon   i got to stop them before they put that sketch out   hi  this is detective scanlon   it s going to voice mail   lee   it s allison   uh  listen  uh   that sketch that i did   with your artist this afternoon   um  do me a favor and don t distribute it   until i talk to you   okay  i guess i ll talk to you in the morning   all right  your mom s going to be tied up most of the day   so i ll be picking you up this afternoon  okay   okay  daddy   all right  kiddo give me a kiss   bye   daddy  how can we tell mr  reshmi   that he needs to lock his back door   tell who what   mr  reshmi   i had a dream that somebody   broke into the place where he lives   mr  reshmi   what  the credit card guy   you had a dream about the credit card guy   i saw his name on the apartment door   these robbers  they came in   from the sliding door in the back   i think they took a ring   uh huh  okay   uh  well  look  bridge   like you said  it was just a dream   and even though you dreamt it  doesn t necessarily mean   that it s going to happen   but i don t think it was just a dream   i think we need to warn him   warn him  bridge   okay  even if it was one of  you know  those dreams   there s no way of knowing whether this is something that s   going to happen or something that s already happened   but either way  it couldn t hurt to warn him  could it   bridge  i wouldn t have any idea how to begin finding this guy   i mean  these credit card companies   have thousands of employees   most of the call centers are in india now   well  we could call information   okay   all right  when i go home  i ll  um   i ll call the company and i ll  you know   we ll try and give mr  reshmi a heads up  okay   thanks  daddy   i think mr  reshmi will be really glad you called   oh  and  daddy   make sure he knows that it s the back door  okay   okay   manuel devalos an instinct for justice   the campaign should   keep the public focused on mr  devalos s record   minimize any questions about   how he achieved it   and you can help us do that  mrs  dubois  by being   very clear when you talk to the media   when the word  psychic comes up  you should say that   you ve never been comfortable with that term   in fact  you don t consider yourself psychic   you ve always been highly intuitive   and you ve used that  intuition   to solve a number of cases   well  the newspapers were very definite   about what it was i did for the district attorney   you really think we can get away   with pretending i m not what i am   to be blunt  allison   i don t believe you are what you say you are   not exactly   now  that s not to say that i think you re a fraud   but if i were to accept   everything i hear about you   well  that would make me question   too many of my dearly held assumptions about the world   and the last thing we want to do   is make people question their assumptions   so  we re trying to find language   that fits what you do into the way most people think   people like the word  intuitive   they re comfortable with it   i m comfortable with it   to me  it describes someone who might   use unconventional techniques   in your case  someone who might make leaps in logic   that might elude other investigators   occasionally  one of those leaps in logic   might come to you in a dream   is that a pretty fair description of what you do   actually  that s an excellent description   and i don t have a problem   with it  either   that  to me  sounds like someone   i would want to have working for the good guys   mm   good   mm   i m surrendering   i m surrendering   my name s jed garrity   i m a captain in the 101st infantry unit   i expect all rights due to me   allison  are you all right   i m fine   i m sorry  sir  did you say something to me   i did   i said i think we accomplished   a great deal here this morning  don t you   definitely   vanilla cappuccino   uh  yeah  nonfat   uh   i wanted to thank you for making me 86 those wanted posters   depicting our own senator garrity   as a murder suspect   we got a dna match for the body   i assume this guy doesn t look familiar   no  he does not   wait  this is the murder victim   turns out he s from corpus christi   name is gordon laroche   and seeing as he was 59 instead of 20   like the guy you dreamed about  i figured that   maybe you were wrong about everything   well  i guess i was   this guy laroche must ve had   the same tattoo as the man i dreamt about   well  this is great news   thank you   okay  so i never reached out to mr  reshmi   would you have spent the afternoon dialing india   no  probably not  but i wouldn t have told our daughter   i was going to do it in the first place   well  i m pretty sure this falls   under the category of white lie   as far as she s concerned mr  reshmi is buying a lock   for his back door right now   and i m fine with that   what   nothing  you re probably right   she ll probably never know   unless  of course  she has another dream about him   and if she does and she sees his apartment s been broken into   well  then  she ll be positive her father lied to her   i m not sure that our nine year old is really clear   on the difference between a white lie and a regular one   i guess i m calling india   looks like the welcome committee got to you   you got a name  soldier   jed garrity   i m a captain   welcome to hell captain garrity   i m from corpus christi   the name s laroche   gordon laroche   senator garrity and gordon laroche   knew each other   they spent four years in a prisoner of war camp together   they even marched side by side   in a memorial day parade in 2002   i can prove it  i found this   on the internet this morning   there is a connection between these two men   i know   i found out they knew each other yesterday   turns out laroche had quite the gambling problem   owed money to bookies in four states   i looked at his bank statements yesterday   even when laroche wasn t working   he still had chunks of money coming in every so often   8 500 here  ten grand there   a lot of that money came in the form of personal checks   from jed garrity   as a matter of fact   he sent laroche a check for 15 grand   just last christmas   so you thinking what i m thinking   what s that   isn t it obvious   garrity was making down payments on laroche s limbs   it s kind of an expensive meal  but  hey   when you ve got a ravenous appetite for human flesh   i guess you have to expect to pay through the nose   great  it s comedy   it s cop comedy  the best kind   what do you want  allison   it looks to me like every so often   senator garrity would try to bail his old war buddy out of trouble   should i send a squad car over to his place   charge him with being a nice guy   you don t think it s a strange coincidence   laroche turns up murdered in garrity s hometown   not really   especially since laroche owed money   to at least two loan sharks in phoenix   tell you what   i m going to spend my morning working the whole   shady guys laroche owed money to  thing   i might even follow up on the fact that   at 10 00 on the night he was killed   laroche s hotel manager   saw him get into the passenger side   of a silver sedan and drive off   but  hey  if you want to  uh  pursue your   senator cannibal  theory by all means  feel free   be sure and let me know if anything breaks   allison   hello   are you headed up to manny s office   yeah  i am   are you leaving   i thought you two were working together this morning   we were  but i had to reschedule   a friend of mine died   i ve got to fly out to texas   to pay my respects to his family   oh  i m sorry to hear that   were you close   once upon a time   we were in the service together   well  i have to admit  sir   i know a little bit about your background   about the things that you ve lived through   i imagine that the bonds that you develop   during war are very strong   you have my condolences   that s very kind of you   but the truth is  i ve been out of touch   with gordon for  oh   it must be almost 15 years now   really  you didn t have any contact at all   i d think that people who shared those kinds of experiences   would keep in touch   unfortunately  my friend and i became very different people   we just drifted apart   gordon and i saw each other at a funeral   must ve been  oh   91 or so   we haven t even spoken since then   allison  are you all right   you look a little pale   i m fine  sir   suprabhaat  ubient credit  bangalore   hi  do you speak english   yes  sir  how can i help you   hi  i m looking for an employee of ubient credit   i don t have a first name but his last name is reshmi   your office in bombay said that they thought that   he might work at this branch   that s right  sir maneck reshmi   let me see if he s started his shift   hello  this is mr  reshmi   hello  mr  reshmi   my name is joe dubois   i live in phoenix  arizona   uh  you may recall you had a conversation   with my daughter the other day   uh  she s nine   you spoke of all the interesting places that you get to call   yes  sir  i  think i remember   how can i help you   would you like to arrange a payment   no  no  actually uh  i am  uh   i m calling to talk to you about   home security   i don t think i understand   uh  uh   i m calling to ask you to buy a lock   for your back door   uh  you know  the kind that that  uh   makes it impossible to slide open   um  uh   you know what i m talking about  right   you you have a sliding door   i do   and you re calling me because   you d like me to buy a lock for it   that s right  i would   uh  i know this sounds  uh  odd   i m afraid i don t understand  sir   are you trying to sell me a product   no  uh  i just want you to tell me   that you re going to buy a lock   i ll tell you what   i ll pay for it   okay   uh  those locks are cheap  right   what  uh  what about  about  25   i ll send you a personal check   if you are going to send a check   why don t you let me credit it to your account   no  no  no  no  no   no  it s for the lock   you got to buy the lock   uh  i m still confused  mr  dubois   why exactly are you so concerned with my home security   uh  look  it s  uh   it s my daughter   um  my daughter liked you   um   actually  she s worried about you   and and  i promised   that i would try to get ahold of you   so what do you say  huh   it s not every day   that a stranger from another continent offers   to buy you a free lock   so  you sent him a check anyway   yeah  i sent him a check anyway   you know  i think i need to talk to devalos   to warn him about garrity   warn him about what exactly   i don t know   all of it  the things i ve been seeing in my dreams   two days from now   devalos is supposed to stand shoulder to shoulder   with garrity in front of every reporter in phoenix   can you imagine what would happen   if garrity becomes a suspect in a murder investigation   it would be the end of devalos s political career   well  maybe  but there s nothing   to indicate garrity s going to become a suspect   what about this   the night of the murder   someone picked up laroche from his hotel in a silver sedan   garrity drives a silver sedan   that s not exactly a smoking gun   every male in the developed world   has owned a silver sedan at some point in his life   uh  that s pretty much what scanlon said to me   when i called him this afternoon   all right  then why do i keep seeing things   that tell me that garrity s a bad guy   why did he look me straight in the face and lie to me   he told me he hadn t been in touch with laroche for years   he sent him  15  last christmas   the two of them were in a parade less than five years ago   what is he trying to hide   rhoades has dysentery   he s dying   he s not going to last more than a week   now  we can just let it happen   and who knows how many of us are going   to starve to death before he dies   or his death can mean something   it can help us live   what are you talking about  captain garrity   if rhoades dies  how does that help us live   are you saying what i think you re saying   we don t have any food   rhoades is dying anyway  so we just   help him along   then we get to live   no   no way   i can t do that   we all have to be in on this   we all have to agree   and we all have to eat   god  i m so hungry   fine   but which of us is going to do it   who s going to kill rhoades   we ll draw for it   thank god   two straws left captain garrity   looks like it s between me and you   let s just do this  laroche   where am i   am i home  captain garrity   not yet   but you will be soon   let me be sure i understand you   a young man named michael rhoades   died in a vietnamese prisoner of war camp   more than 30 years ago   and it s your belief that jed garrity murdered him   then  ate him   garrity didn t want to do it   he was starving to death   all the prisoners were   he did it so the rest of them could survive   and you think that all of this is somehow connected   to a murder that occurred four days ago   gordon laroche was in that camp with garrity   he was in the room   when garrity killed michael rhoades   his gambling debts are out of control   senator garrity was giving laroche money   and lots of it   what if they were blackmail payments   what if laroche said to garrity   he was going to expose their little secret   if garrity didn t paid him off   don t you think it s possible   garrity killed laroche to protect himself  his career   no   actually  allison  i don t   even if i were willing to concede that   many years ago  in some of the direst circumstances imaginable   jed garrity did a terrible thing so that he could survive   i refuse to believe that he had anything to do   with the murder of that man scanlon found   the other night   this is a man that i ve known for more than 20 years   someone who has been decorated with the highest medal   the military has to give   and if you re going to come to my house   and accuse him of murder  i need something   more than dreams about a prisoner of war camp   there is more   10 00  the night of the murder   someone drove laroche from his hotel   in a silver sedan   garrity drives   a silver sedan   now  i think i m going to have to bring this to scanlon   and i really think you should distance yourself   from that man before i do   and you say this all happened on sunday night   senator garrity was with me at 10 00 p m  on sunday night   sitting right in this very room   as a matter of fact   that was the night he came to see me   about running for district attorney   we sat right here   drinking whiskey and talking until just before midnight   i m sorry to deflate   your theory  allison   but the silver sedan you re referring to was parked   in my driveway the entire evening   dad   do you know some guy named mr  reshmi   he called when i was on the other line   thanks  hello   hello  mr  dubois   i  i hope i m not reaching you at a bad time   uh  no  no  i can talk for a couple minutes   what s up   thieves broke into my apartment last night   they came in through the back door   i m afraid they took everything they could carry   they even found a ring i had been saving for my engagement   i have to know  mr  dubois   how exactly did you think to advise me to buy a lock   on the very day i was about to be robbed   um  well  uh   it really has nothing to do with me   uh  like i told you it s my daughter   um  she  uh  she worries about people   and at times  it it   seems like she s very   prescient   do you know what i mean by that   i think i can guess   will you please tell her   i appreciate her efforts on my behalf   i will   i i wish i had been more convincing   and i wish that i had listened to you   i also thought you d like to know   that your family s status with the company has changed   your account was previously classified as urgent   someone was meant to call your home every day   until we received payment   based on the conversations we had   i have reclassified your file as payment pending   it should be quite some time   before it s reclassified as urgent   perhaps 90 days   you re telling me   that nobody s going to call us for three months   that is right  sir   wow  well  i appreciate that   um  are you sure you re comfortable doing that   it is a large company   errors are made   good day  mr  dubois   uh  bridgette wants to know   if  uh  we can contribute a little something   to mr  reshmi s engagement ring fund   oh   i mean  you got to hand it to the girl   she s really built a bridge   between the dubois family and its creditors   well  i m glad one of us is seeing something useful   you know what i can t stop thinking about   is that poor soldier michael rhoades   just a boy  really   and he died half a world away   al   it was horrible  and now   nobody s ever going to know what really happened to him   well  maybe that s a good thing  too   even if you could prove that this guy died   at the hands of his fellow prisoners   what possibly could be gained by exposing it   i mean  imagine the horror his family would feel   if they found out that this kid was eaten   and the men who killed him   i know that they did a terrible thing   but they were in a kind of living hell   and it doesn t sound like they went on   to become career criminals   i know  you re right of course your right   this is what i keep thinking   if i can t tell the truth about michael rhoades   and if i can t help the police solve laroche s murder   then why am i seeing these things   why do i have such horrible things stuck in my head   i don t think i can do this   i m serious  i can t   we ve been over this  evan   none of us wants to do it   gordon s been out of control for a long time   his debts are getting bigger   he keeps coming to us for more money   now he s threatening to take his story to the networks   i know  but you re talking about murdering someone   i haven t held a gun in my hands for over 30 years   i m a doctor now   we ve all built lives for ourselves  that s the point   if laroche comes out and tells the truth   about what we did to rhoades  that s it  we re ruined   i didn t fly out here to have a debate   draw   sorry  evan   look  i know we need to do this   correction  you need to do this   why should i be the only one at risk   we ll all do it   together   if everybody takes part then no one can back out later   no one can become another laroche   we can t blackmail each other   or threaten to go to the authorities   because we ll all be murderers   each one of us will be just as guilty as everybody else   it s the way we should ve done this in the first place   if we all did rhoades together   then laroche would ve had his own skin in the game   and we wouldn t be having this conversation right now   tomorrow night   evan  you tell laroche you need to talk to him   he can come to your house for a drink   put some sleeping pills in his whiskey   we ll all come over later   midnight   we ll kill him together   and then each of us will get rid of a piece of him   evan  you have to bury what s left of him   do you think you can handle that   now let me ask you something   do you own a chain saw   evan sabow   yes   my name s lee scanlon   i m with the phoenix police department   i have few questions for you about  uh   the murder of gordon laroche   you knew him  right   of course  gordon and i go way back   we were in the army together   did you happen to see him this past sunday   sunday  i don t think so  no   you sure  can you remember where you were that night   i was here  i was home all night   are you asking me to account for my whereabouts  detective   hope you re not implying   i had anything to do with gordon s death   nah  i m just checking   can anybody confirm that you were here  wife  kids   no  i m divorced   i was watching television all night  by myself   i like that tattoo   gordon laroche had one just like it   yeah  i know  we uh  we got  em together   a group of guys from our unit got drunk one night   when we were on leave   we all had these when we woke up   wish to god that we hadn t   we were just a bunch of stupid kids   what s in the bag   oh  just some tools  old stuff i was going to get rid of   you mind opening it up for me   you don t have to   we could just wait here together   while somebody drives over a search warrant   that s a nice looking chain saw   you shouldn t keep your tools all mixed up like that  though   they re old  i was going to get rid of them   hmm  that smells like bleach   no wonder you re looking to dump that thing   it s not going to last very long if you use bleach to clean it   i really don t see that that s any of your business  detective   funny thing about chain saws  though   they re almost impossible to get completely clean   there s just too many nooks and crannies   so  dr  sabow   if i take a real close look at that thing   you think i ll find some of gordon laroche s blood on it   hello   evan sabow just confessed to the murder of gordon laroche   lee  that s great   have you arrested garrity and the others   no  and right now  it doesn t look like we re going to   what do you mean  why not   sabow confessed  but he s saying it was all him   he says he killed laroche without any help   well  that s not right   laroche was blackmailing all of them   all four of them killed him   not according to sabow   he says laroche borrowed money from him   the two of them had an argument about when laroche was   going to pay him back and it turned physical   he s lying  he s trying to protect the others   i believe you  but we searched his house   there s no evidence that ties anyone else to the murder   none of the neighbors saw anybody   coming or going from the house on the night laroche died   we ll keep working it  but uh  it looks like sabow s   taking the truth to jail with him   so that s it   so garrity and the rest of them just get away with it   i hope not  allison  but at this point  that s a possibility   evan sabow may be a bad murderer  but  uh   i have to admit he s a good soldier   senator garrity   i d like to talk to you about gordon laroche   i m afraid i don t have time for a conversation right now   senator  you really shouldn t be here  mrs  dubois   i m sure you re aware that manny and i have a press conference   starting in just a few minutes   i would hate for any reporters to see you hanging around   you don t want to hear about laroche   why don t we talk about private michael rhoades   would you all excuse us a moment   it s been a long time   since anyone mentioned that name to me   i know what happened in that camp   i know that gordon laroche was blackmailing   all of you about it   and you killed him   that s quite a story   especially since evan sabow just confessed   to gordon s murder   from what i m told  they were having an argument over money   but we know better  don t we   and don t think that you and your friends   are just going to walk away from this   i am going to find a way to prove that you did it   that sounds like a tall order   the killer s in jail  he freely admits to his crime   and i must say  i don t understand why a woman   of your obvious talents would waste her time   on a piece of business like this one   the four of you killed someone   fair enough   but let me make sure i ve got your story right   a long time ago  a soldier died   so that the men he served with could survive   my guess is  they were probably aware of the burden   that the death of michael rhoades placed on them   who knows  maybe they even made anonymous contributions   to the family of that poor  dead soldier   seems like the least they could do   if these men had any kind of decency at all   it seems to me they would live their lives   in a way that honored the sacrifice   that made them possible   don t expect me to sympathize with you   you gave up your right to understanding   when you murdered gordon laroche   right  gordon laroche   he s the sticking point here  isn t he   if you re right about any of this   he s the only one who made it out of that camp   who didn t understand the legacy that rhoades left behind   the only one who didn t hold himself to a higher standard   in fact it sounds like you think laroche tried to exploit   that terrible time for his personal gain   and he tried to drag the rest of those survivors down   into the mess he had made for himself   would i be sorry that someone like that was gone   not at all   he wasn t worthy of the life another man gave him   now  if you ll excuse me  allison   i have to go help put your boss back in office   a man i happen to believe will do a lot of good   a man i believe will help you do a lot of good   and that s all most of us want  isn t it   a chance to do something

            "CHUNK 1:  in the name of god the most gracious the most merciful from muhammad the messenger of god to heraclius the emperor of byzantium greetings to him who is the follower of righteous guidance i bid you to hear the divine call i am the messenger of god to the people accept islam for your salvation he speaks of a new prophet in arabia was it like this when john the baptist came to king herod out of the desert crying about salvation to muqawqis patriarch of alexandria kisra emperor of persia muhammad calls you with the call of god accept islam for your salvation embrace islam you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat to tell persia where he should kneel muhammad messenger of god who gave him this authority god sent muhammad as a mercy to mankind the scholars and historians of islam the university of al azhar in cairo the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message therefore the person of mohammad will not be shown 600 years after christ died when europe was sunk in the dark ages and everywhere the old civilizations were falling muhammad was born in mecca in arabia mecca was then a rich trading city ruled by its merchants whose wealth was multiplied by a unique privilege they housed the gods every year at the time of the great fair the desert priests brought their idols and the images of their gods into the custody of the kaaba once the most holy shrine of abraham the kaaba had now become a house of idolotry hosting no fewer than 360 different gods mecca in 610 a d bilal have you had today s count umaya not yet but this year the gods are gold when you put the gods and prophet together you sit very pretty between hmm and more gods to place in the kaaba caravan from syria hmm they must have been running they ll be thirsty put five more men on north wells how many sheep shall i have to kill for them 70 give them a hundred mecca must keep her name for hospitality and ten lambs for the leaders bread and water do the poets have in the hakim s house where verse and prose are nightly put to slaughter and and the bread i swear in there is thinner than the water oh open the space open the space you lovers of poetry to abu sufian willing and which patron of the arts when abu sofyan invites the poet in their joy is kit and love is kin where wines and cakes abound the skills of abu sofyan all revels and all songs begin when abu sofyan invites the poet in from the silkworms of china my lady a pleasure to the limb and as my lady can see a ravish to the eye yes 7 lengths 20 dinars abu sofyan s wife 15 oh gold the gods of the kaaba have their needs their upkeeps who is that man who stood there who looked into my soul carry me away from here why must muhammad come down here why don t you stop him he is your nephew maybe he will change change he is 40 years old it s unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave it is unnatural for a man who dares to risk the anger of al uzza who keeps our health manat the god of our prosperity allat the god of our family and tribes and hubal hubal who starts our caravans and predicts our fate to challenge the gods within earshot of the gods is dangerous unreasonable rebellious blasphemous yes i m afraid muhammad will harm himself i am always sad when the great fair is over i might not see the next one abu talib abu talib catch your breath zaid has muhammad come down from mount hira yet he s been up there three days no no i haven t seen him khadijah hoped he might have come to you on his way home then he s still up there three days i m afraid for him on the mountain because i don t know what it means men see the world too well from a mountain muhammad read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read he s still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain he was alone in the cave suddenly an angel came in to him the angel said read muhammad replied i can not read the angel commanded again read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read who knows if it was gabriel it could have been a dream when muhammad was coming from the mountain he saw gabriel plainly in the shape of a man standing on the horizon wherever he looked upon every turn of his head he saw him and gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and you muhammad are the messenger of god who has he told about this his wife and ali and his friend abu bakr and you i am his adopted son be careful to whom you talk tell him his uncle who protected him when he was a child will protect him still after all they say the god of moses spoke to him out of a burning bush if you do not restrain your nephew then we will he s dividing the city heart against house he s dividing the generations child against parent the young are listening to him he attracts the young we are arabs we obey our fathers our children cannot be our teachers how can we accept that the man we met in the street yesterday can be some god s prophet today dead bones can live again he says because he who created man can also make man return from the dead he says the gods might leave us and give their benefits to another city tell him we will give him authority position and keys to the kaaba and money what money he wants tell him we will give him anything he wants muhammad spare yourself and me do not put a greater burden on an old man that he can bear in your childhood you were in my arms i cannot now see you hurt if you refuse them they will hurt you he said this to me were they to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left i would not renounce my message which is from god when i am dead you may do as you please but whilst i m alive you will obey your father why did you hurt our father if i were drunk every day and played dice every night you d call it high spirits you will be more my brother than you are now you are all my children i ve given you everything i could but it seems not to be enough muhammad gives me more he give all the world more get him out of here father it s not waleed or me it s our father you tortured him wait hudayfa wait how can they say it s an invention musab when it isn t new in mecca it s new yet god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all the prophets but people changed it turned it forgot it now god said it to muhammad again and it is new again what is it it s jafar what have you brought with you the very word of god when the sun is overthrown when the stars fall when the mountains vanish when the camels big with young are abandoned when the wild beasts are herded together when the seas rise when the souls are sorted when the female infant who is buried alive asks for what crime she was killed when the books are opened when the sky is torn away then every soul will know what it has done were you\n",

fortunate always fortunate with your mother yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yasser and you were nearly never born i was to be buried like my two sisters but my father couldn t do it he couldn t do it the third time when the second girl was being when my father was putting sand over her she took hold of his finger the way a baby does he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased and he dared take away his hand when i was born my father ran out of the house screaming that he couldn t do it again that he could never do it again

god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black bilal who i paid money for equal to me yes muhammad says before god all men are as equal as the teeth of a comb this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars it gives them pretensions bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave take that

drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is

there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we

nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one\n",

desert yet so profound were the consequences so lasting were the effects of this walk that from it the muslims date their calendar in this moment islam found it s future muhammad himself stayed in mecca in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely muhammad has become a nation he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties and you salool who claim to be king of medina lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed you should worry about yourself abu sufian every time you trade a whiff of perfume out the city you must creep past that man in medina he is

young men each from a different family my own son ikrima is with them they will stab him together if the responsibility for his death is shared where lies the guilt my idea i m not sure i m part of it muhammad s body contains too much his mind his words but it is an ingenious solution and a final one no ali his cousin laid there to die for him who are we fighting they cannot go far all the tracks are watched he must take to the desert bakkah will give 100 camels to the man who brings back muhammad or his head look for 3 of them muhammad abu bakr and uriqat his bedouin guide what is it they re not grazing camel maybe two days that from the city why are you here medina is to the north they make the tracks not i nomads travelling west i know my art they say that you can track a bird by smelling the air we go with them he may be in that cave over there muhammad if you come out we will take you to mecca alive muhammad come out they can t be in there this this web is unbroken and these pigeons they would not build we were wrong to follow them we should have gone north let s move then we still have time to head them off a few threads of a spider s web were all that was then between muhammad and murder but he was a man not to be killed the bedouin guide led him and his companion abu bakr in their escape through untracked spaces of the desert and the heat of the june days at medina his followers waited with their welcome ready but in great fear for his journey anything no nothing he himself says he is only a man no man can survive that heat there i see them look run and hide i may be obliged to free you as a gesture welcome to the city of medina the blessed your city messenger of god you will stay with me messenger of god i have the best house in medina you will give me the honor of keeping you stay with me please please please how can the prophet choose between so many welcomes where god guides his camel to stop there he will build his house all agreed we turn

drum there s too much blood in a drum why not the human voice as in umar ibn khattab s vision the prophet agrees he means you bilal me you have a good voice use it climb up there brothers today a man of medina will embrace a man of mecca each will share half and half reach out embrace your neighbor and brother i m tired of the politics of kissing slaves read this the prophet should concern himself with the after world how is my son praying like a horse does it burn your hands if it s not torn up it will burn down the house he s making laws like a king he has declared that loyalty to islam is more than loyalty to tribal family what all muslims are next of kin to one another don t be mislead by that they must change the nature of the tribes before that the danger is here equality a man s neighbour is as good as himself the lunatic means it jews and christians have equal rights with muslims the jews who attach themselves to a common wealth shall be protected women have rights of inheritance rights next he ll be giving the camel rights he has the lunatic has you can t overload them he s remaking a city my city damn him he s taken our sons from us our future from us his rights

agree with this muhammad the messenger of god if i have thought you were the messenger of god i would not have fought you make it muhammad the son of abdullah agrees with suhayl the son of amr that is more factual well so i understand good that is better now it is agreed that you do not continue your pilgrimage you must turn around and go home mecca is home however you may continue your pilgrimage next year and for 3 days only in and out we also agree to the truce for 10 years during that time you will not attack any tribe or ambush any caravan or any individual associated with us and vice

who muhammad is muhammad there is still doubt in my heart if i were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts khalid there s no compulsion in religion a man may take many years or only need minutes it s god who decides the time so respect his doubts you re a black slave you are the best school i am only what god has given me yes the gods that i worshipped they don t have any use it would have helped me i declare under no compulsion there is one god and you are the messenger of god now let me go get inside no doors may be broken down nothing\n",

yoshiko sakuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku special joint investigation meeting hey here they come chief what was the meeting about what are you investigating is tatsumura involved there are rumors that sanritsu industries is behind all this isn t its president tatsumura the mastermind behind this incident aren t you flooded with complaints about police ineffectiveness in the case they say the authorities are too cautious or worse weak kneed i ll ask you the same question what do you guys think it s easy to criticize others but are you trying to bring back the old heavy handed police power it s not as if cautious investigation is bad and that s part of the difficulty of this job it s not you who s been getting your men killed at every turn it s me oh hi the press yeah i got a little excited i went to the farewell ceremony for detective sugiyama i see well that s three in a row what a shame yeah and the meeting it s like we ve hit a dead end we don t have a concrete plan all the violent incidents in this neighborhood are connected to sanritsu industries i m sure i m on the right track but i don t know where to start to catch them by the tail we don t have a single clue we re helpless it s our own fault that the city is calling us weak kneed the three men who died would turn in their graves sanritsu industries business information chairman saichi sakura president j go tatsumura i just had an idea i heard a rumor on the street tatsumura has recently taken complete control of the organization they say things are getting awkward with his uncle sakura mmm hmm so if we can crack the organization by successfully exploiting this opportunity we might be able to get some clues for the investigation i see but that would require of course we can t do it alone we really need the help of a man knowledgeable about the organization mmm hmm a kind of guerrilla operation interesting idea but i don t know if there s anybody who could be that useful i actually have a little bit of an idea about that oh who is it tojima brothers hello hello coming oh old man hi hi welcome are you two working together no she wouldn t stop asking me to show her how to fix it boy you look terrible oh did you have the ceremony yet no not yet it seems rather silly to call it a wedding now but we ll invite you when we do mr ogata sure please come in okay it looks like two more cars have been added after not coming here for a while but the two drivers are unavailable so they re just like decorations now please have a seat okay hard working kind hearted she ll make a good wife yeah i suppose so so what brought you here today well it s kind of hard to say what i m asking you to do actually i just wanted to ask you to go back to the old you the old me yes a yakuza old man don t joke around with me i wouldn t joke about asking you to do this please i really need your help what s the story you want me to be a g man you re no stranger to tatsumura i would like to ask you to do this and let me assure you this isn t about saving the face of the police or anything we have to crush that germ like organization as soon as possible old man if you want to talk about that please take it up with someone else i m asking because i know i can count on you it s not a job that just anybody can do don t give me too much credit i m not that respectable but first of all i don t want to do anything that ll open old wounds okay maybe i shouldn t have asked you to do it why don t you get out of this business i d be happy to help you find a job it would be my pleasure but i m a man with no education at all living only for this job since i was a simple police officer the grime sticks and doesn t seem to come off i might have to die to get it clean i m sorry i can t help you it s okay i ll definitely attend your wedding yeah bye oh is mr ogata going home already yes oh what was that about it has nothing to do with us yes this is tojima transport co huh what s up it s the usual hello how s it going are you ready to accept our protection i refuse i don t want to be under your care think carefully about it without a driver there wouldn t be any business you know what what did he say this time don t worry about it huh the car s back oof brother osamu osamu what s wrong he said he got jumped by thugs thugs yeah let s go inside to treat the wound yes so when did you get out today i was on my way here i was surprised to see that the truck was marked tojima transport boss i m quitting no matter how many lives i have it won t be enough what are you saying the two guys taking a break must have gone through the same thing i did you can t tell us to fight the yakuza let s do it bro i can help you to be honest i m disappointed that you quit the business osamu what have you learned from four years in juvie i m not going to fight i m going now because they re probably waiting for me you re free to quit you can take your salary up to today bro bro i m disappointed in you bro where s the brother that i used to know i m sure he wouldn t just sit back and let this happen to him idiot damn it you re not my brother osamu don t talk to your brother like that take care of yourself thank you but you know don t you think it s frustrating when you re provoked like that it s frustrating but we ll be out of business if we take on every fight we re not selling fights but you were the boss s daughter you should understand how i feel i ve forgotten you know the old days both your brother and i suit yourself no wonder my brother became a coward his wife s too beautiful and too decent sassy little thing aren t you you should look before you say something weird tojima brothers you see this business belongs to you and your brother damn it my brother he your

that well go ahead sorry because of my mess even your store is no actually my business is being blackmailed too you too jo yeah in the beginning they called me to invite me when i refused the thugs came i told em to look people in the eye when talking and threw em out and here we are today you didn t report it to the police did you yeah i thought about that but if the cops are there all day long no customers will come they predicted that much all right do you know which group the thugs belonged to they belong to the takeda family down the street i think sanritsu industries is the mastermind behind the protection racket i heard that the takeda family s boss became a shareholder of sanritsu industries the other day i think that s fishy i didn t know that a champion huh well i m past my prime if i m remembering the old days welcome back oh what happened to your car uh what happened to the drivers well did they all quit yes but that s okay hire someone new again maybe i should learn to drive what about tomorrow s work i turned it down earlier i m sure it s not a good time come on tonight is osamu s welcome home party it s going to be at my apartment osamu what s wrong i showed those guys from the takeda family how strong i got in juvie idiot what would you do if something happened to you worry more about yourself than you do about me osamu what happened ouch captain fujikawa was happy that you agreed we ll help as much as we can but this work is informal yes so it s strange when i m the one asking you to do this but you take good care of yourself and old man you needn t worry about that i m willing to do it even if no one asks me to do it well i feel better now that you put it that way and what about your subordinates i want to work in my own way so i m going to get five or six guys who are used to fighting what i d really like from you is a car that starts fast i ve already got it for you i ve got a good driver too come with me now okay why did we stop

world of men that women don t understand right bro you go live with her and get a job that s stupid please please don t do it did you forget what happened four years ago didn t you almost die trying to crawl out of the muck don t get desperate just because things aren t working here we can go somewhere where there are no yakuza please please don t do it i m sorry but i ve made up my mind this time i m going to do it my way that s right that s right brother but you can t do it alone bro hey please let me do it i ll bring my friends if you want idiot i said no you can t do it pack your bags with her i ve now given you the gist of it i d really like some help from you all i just want to assure you that we re subcontracting for the police it s low pay despite the risk i d like to know if you re still willing to take it on please don t hesitate to tell me when you say subcontracting for the police how will you start first i ll pretend to make a comeback to the yakuza then i ll infiltrate their organization under the guise of a turf war that would mean we re the tojima family gentlemen this is the perfect role for you if you look in the mirror i think you ll see what i mean i don t want to flatter you but i d hardly call you all good citizens but it takes a hell of a lot of guts and horsepower to hit them you re all perfect team members in that regard hey bro even though it s police work we re putting our lives on the line there will be a little reward won t there i can t guarantee that i m sure you ll manage it just fine but don t forget there s a policeman next to you so let s hear your answer can you guys give me a hand let s show them what we can do i ll get tatsumura back for his protection racket how about you matsushima well i m being asked to take care of the car i don t see anyone else qualified goro i ll do my best to save the extra money mr policeman it s my duty so i ll do whatever you scared me osamu brother don t treat me like a stranger everyone

whose territory this is you sure aren t tight lipped are you i ll have what he s having i hear a retired yakuza named tojima is making a comeback well i m sure there will be an uproar now i don t think tatsumura will allow it but tojima and tatsumura must have been like brothers people only think that s true they don t get along with each other very well i m telling you this for your own good if you want to make a living as a yakuza it s smarter to join tatsumura thanks for the advice if you want i can ask the higher ups for you did tatsumura ask you to scout for the yakuza huh you ll have to ask tatsumura if you can hire a guy named tojima then you re next time you see me call me tojima recreation center construction who are you you almost got yourself killed do you know what s going on here i do but thanks anyway don t get me wrong i m here to kill you don t move do you recognize this face five years ago five years ago in a turf war on the beach you shot a guy named kuroki then you re kuroki s i m his younger brother now that you remember i m going to kill you wait that wasn t supposed to be a fatal injury no respectable doctor would ve treated that wound it s no wonder it was fatal i made a vow then i swore i d kill you if i ever saw you are you hurt you think you saved me that doesn t make up for my brother wait a minute i get how you feel but i ve got a job i ve got to do i won t let you stop me boss are you hurt i m fine the advertisement worked 100 i ve already got a lot of sponsors that s the guy him a debt is a debt i ll wait until your job is done in exchange i m not leaving your side for a while i won t let you die until it s by my hand so you re a bodyguard well okay he s an old friend of mine try to get along starting tomorrow we re going to be busy sanritsu industries boss tojima is here what do you want to do i thought they d be here by now hey to what do we owe this surprise it s been a while how s your shipping company doing i heard you were happy together with the previous boss s daughter i don t think i can make a living as an honest man i m going back to the old tojima i see that s why you came all the way out here to say hello shimadzu let s celebrate tojima s comeback book a welcome home party you already threw me a welcome home party a fancy one with lead bullets i know it was supposed to be a fireworks show but it was very much your style tojima you ve become nastier living as an honest man i m not as bad as you you took over this building in less than four years i was hoping you d tell me how to make money that s the kind of advice one can only get from a professional i wish you d stop with the innuendos sanritsu industries is a legitimate company and we pay our taxes if you want you can go ask the tax office but i hear there s a lot of money to be made without the tax office knowing what do you mean for example protection rackets that sort of work fits these guys don t move what s this a raccoon dog s tail i m the one who built all this i have some allies but also many enemies you can never be too careful everyone leave us i think it s time to cut to the chase i m being extorted it seems no i just need a little help it s a lot of work to make up for four years of absence i d like to borrow your territory for a while for old time s sake sorry i don t have anything like that right now i have enough to eat running a theater and a recreation center oh yeah that s a relief then i ll make my own territory without reservation that s all well and good but be careful they say once a boxer retires he never makes a comeback again jinxes can be broken someday you know well look forward to it i see tojima has shown up so now tatsumura has more things to worry about that s why he tried to get rid of him last night that was a screw up out of character for tatsumura i m getting lucky it s good to live a long time you ve pit the two against each other for your own advantage i m the one who originally created sanritsu industries after all i didn t want to keep it in tatsumura s care forever so shall we propose the election of a new president at the next general meeting no i think we ll wait and see what tojima does chairman hmm mr tojima has come to say hello to you good thing he came now have him come over here mr chairman it s been a while yeah a while i hear you made a comeback the other day yeah i ll need your help again yeah sure but now i m practically retired but i heard a rumor that you ll be returning as president of sanritsu once again there are too many irresponsible rumors out there i agree i was even gossiping with tatsumura just now with tatsumura they say you had a dispute last night that s just another irresponsible rumor but you better be careful it s weird saying this to your face i ve always preferred you to tatsumura if you ever need help i m always here for you oh i ll see you then well i ll leave you alone for today this is a fine house for an old fox s nest and they re even planning to expand the place sanritsu industries i see that old man and tojima huh i think we can still do something about it now you re something yourself too what are you after the sakura family s territory well if that s on the table okay i ll grant you that in exchange get to work eliminate the old man boss he s your blood relative i don t remember having an uncle like that murakami take the kijima brothers mr chairman these men say that they came from tatsumura what do they want can t you handle it yourself no i definitely can t what are you doing stop it you chairman of sanritsu industries murdered killing anyone who gets in the way but this is too much this is exactly how tatsumura works now their organization is strengthened again we have to find a new way to get inside welcome can i get you a drink i don t have any money here let me pay with this we re supposed to ask for cash don t be so uptight i heard whose restaurant this is welcome eh are you the one i need to talk to maybe we ll see boy where are you from check the family register no comment well i want a clear answer come this way here the pistol wait here manager s office i have someone we could use we heard your story go home for today what we have to check if the gun has been used in a crime if you can t tell by holding it then you re an amateur what that gun isn t loaded you re not qualified to be a bouncer move are you the boss if you really want to work here do as you re told waving that thing around won t get you anywhere got it got it nice to meet you the takeda family controls the bar area here the bars and cabarets in this area are the yoshi family s territory both are backed by sanritsu industries i m sure just as i thought so what s the connection between tatsumura and the owners it doesn t seem to be just protection rackets i bet they re into something more profitable than that okay this is their turf anyway let s provoke them one by one tojima s taking over this bar get lost goons motherfucker get him what the hell you guys the tojima family s taking over this place now if you want protection money we refuse what how did you do good ah now the takeda family s stronghold let s all go together what s that i got it from the bar earlier but there are some weird symbols in the purchase column let s check the next place too go back and tell your boss tojima is taking over this business for a while it d be interesting to find a similar ledger let s check around yeah somewhere like in here this is why amateurs are no good leave these things to the professionals it s just been high school so far now comes the college class find anything nothing of value it s written the same way as this what could this mean i m sure it has something to do with their organization six people just six people and they re raiding turf all over the place and what do you want me to do i m truly ashamed actually i m going to take care of this right now i just wanted to let you know in that case leave him be let him do his thing for a while but that s don t you get it what s a couple of cabarets and bars the point is to keep our organization unnoticed wait and see what they uncover sanritsu industries hey huh so what are they doing they re not moving at all the car s crying we ll let it rest while it can what the hell is going on he s wearing a sanritsu badge who are you calling oh it s you bro don t scare me i was just about to call you come here what the hell is going on here i used my brain a little not many people know that you and i are brothers right because we have different last names so i figured it was up to me to sneak into tatsumura s place i told you that you can t it s too late i m in so you don t want to hear what i got you got something actually i m just about to get it idiot you ve got me beat well then brother but be careful you re talking with the enemy if you re as careless as you were just now you re dead they re totally systematic in that organization unless you re a real old timer you can t figure out anything it seems so i tried to step on his income streams but it didn t work so well i m sure he s got some big source of money i ll find it eventually see you later brother all right place your bets but think carefully before betting watch closely here we go that one you choose this one are you sure this is the one too bad i feel bad about taking from a cop okay one more time we have a visitor hey stop they ve been going to bars and cabarets for a while they don t seem to be collecting laundry what are they doing okay i ll find out give me a hand hey can i get a light thanks hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey what do we do what do we do good it s a red light you stupid bastard you had me worried i see so the dry cleaner was a collector yeah but where is that money coming from a bag this big with a bunch of bills in it and instead of laundry there s a load of whiskey a daihatsu midget whiskey and wads of cash what kind of mystery is this we ll have to poke around more come on come on i went to see mr ogata i was hoping to ask mr ogata to stop you and he told me the truth you should have just told me am i such an unreliable woman no this is my problem i thought i d washed my hands of the business but they don t respect that i had to do it to break free i understand but this is not just about you good luck you re doing a good thing for the world but don t overdo it when i lie in bed there s a man when i drink wine there are two men when i walk down the street there are three men they all stare at me dead boss tojima is here what okay i ll check it out the people who loved me they all disappear little red flowers in the heart are hickeys made of lead bullets what s up are you still scouting for recruits not anymore i found a really good warrior i think you re in the wrong place is that so i think i read the sign properly and i came in i think the woman made a mistake too aren t you just a kid don t smoke what i ve got a lead i m counting on it punch me once you son of a bitch what should we do what s he up to let s go hold on wait a little longer check the moonshine got it i ll leave that to you oh hello metropolitan police listen i m at the night castle cabaret there are drunks rampaging yes please come you re saved by the bell it s a draw something extra i wonder if it s just a turf war no it can t be moonshine this was the key to their secret organization so through the bosses of the amusement quarters they would get this moonshine into bars cabarets and clubs then they paid profit dividends to the shareholders then this ledger is likely a record of moonshine sales i wonder how much money they can make on this if they put import prices on such cheap liquor they ll make twenty times as much twenty times and it s not taxed compared to that protection rackets are nothing in any case we re going to find out where the moonshine factory is then we can have them by the throat first let s do all we can to find the couriers wait a second what s that they re collecting empty bottles so they finally have a job that looks like a job that s kind of weird what those two cars behind us they ve been following us for a while now here they come hey that s one gone hey here they come again damn it that was close good job hey matsushima what s wrong oh stupid son of a bitch why didn t you tell me sooner this car was entrusted to me i can t leave it with anyone you re stubborn what s wrong we got shot at while tailing the bottle collection truck call a doctor if it gets in the papers they re gonna find out it s no time for talk like that wait lay him down over there stay sitting don t just stand there run hot water will it work it didn t work out for my brother because it was close to his vital organs but it s going to be okay this time come on bite down harder hey he only fainted it s done so their focus is now on the organization by the looks of it they re doing a lot of research maybe he s a rat for the cops no way no way would the cops trust a yakuza but this needs a thorough investigation if he s willing to go so far i have an idea too i came here today to talk to you on behalf of tatsumura so now you re going to join me and take down tatsumura tatsumura wants to have a peaceful talk with you i m gonna use this for a moment hello hey it s me yeah i m giving him the phone now it s tatsumura hello tojiima it s me i don t have anything to talk to you about now you might not but i do say would you like to hear a pretty woman s voice what would you like to say something she doesn t seem to have anything to say but you re not an idiot so i m sure you ll back off quietly don t give in

geordie to see what he could find out about ronnie he s not being treated in any hospital i don t think he has cancer once a chancer always a chancer jack wants me to divorce him but a vow s a vow isn t it till death do us part i said those words in church in front of god so he took my lovely locket he took my savings i m a fool we re hypocrites we stand up there and we preach in certainties if you behave like this you ll be rewarded if you don t you ll be punished we are preaching to ourselves too we can all learn from god s words no one expects you to be perfect yes they do the church does you do i struggle sidney we all struggle so why don t we tell people that we tell people to lead a perfect life and when they don t we are the cause of the suffering not satan not sin we tell people that they re not good enough and then we have the audacity to be shocked when they try and take their own lives who tried to take their own life oh what do you care as long as no one finds out is that what you think of me you come to my house you come to my home you you tell me how to live i shouldn t have to tell you how to live what right do you have every right as a leader of this church you know what they call you the other members of your church they call you uncle tom they smile and they shake your hand and then they laugh at you behind your back you think i don t know that you think i don t see that every day you can respect an institution that treats you like that but of course why because we have a common goal we all want to spread god s word i have been more offended by you than anyone else i should not have to defend the church to a man of god i m not sure there s much to defend then why are you here why haven t you gone i have doubts too and when i do i pray to god you need

as i ve already told you before two grails will soon be collected just get ready for when our prey can you even hold out until then brother nameless girl it s snowing such beautiful snow i m the first to walk on it tanaka will also put footprints down jeez they re always like this they do say that kids are all children of the snow it s children of the wind nee san it s pretty amazing how much snow has accumulated it s because it snowed a lot last night last night onii chan shirou san s story was incredible hearing his story and being able to see him again like this made me really happy although i don t think think onii chan wanted me to return to this world well i guess that s how things ended up what are you doing looking all melancholic want me to teach you how to play with snow listen here kuro playing a kids game in this situa is not the right thing t especially at someone else s house um illya now you ve done it as i thought it turned as expected this gives such a nostalgic feeling indeed indeed indeed we re back welcome back wait what happened to you well i think we overdid just a little bit we sure did go change before you catch a cold okay wait angelica yes where are you going to change clothes in according with your order i wasn t talking to you you can sit back down understood thoroughly like a doll huh seeing miyu in a skirt is so refreshing i always wore one as part of the school uniform though school uniforms are different very good very good lively girls in brand new clothes a sight that melts my heart these clothes a little something i ve prepared for them as ladies you should care about how you dress i don t need a change of clothes i m fine with a normal shirt and a pair of pants my a lady shouldn t be careless about her fashion maybe you should wear clothes more suitable for combat for once my fashion is most suitable for combat you really don t have any skirts what s the problem with the way i dress i should lend you some of mine then wanna get punched thank you tanaka san what s the matter tanaka san you don t like your new clothes or do you want to play in the snow some more she s there tanaka san where are you geez where did illya go she was here just a second ago it seems that tanaka as well for illya i saw her leave just now wait she didn t go outside did she would that be bad yeah the ainsworths only made a temporary retreat we don t know when they might attack us again without ruby the risk is that much higher for her i ll go find her i ll go too the school tanaka san are you alright running off all of a sudden without saying anything is there something in the school you wanted to erika chan um it s erika chan right i see that s my name yes first on the attendance list erika ainsworth what are you doing here you re asking for my reason there hasn t been one not for a long time what are you saying erika chan i want to ask you about something what is julian planning to do with that black box thing i know that he wants to save the world but that s not all there s to it could it be that julian s true wish is for you to be save hey illya onee chan what is it will you save me then i ll save you i ve decided to seek a path where everyone is saved how very much like you illya onee chan so kind let s see well then will you kill me you said you d save me right then go ahead open the pithos and kill me open it and kill you if you do that then maybe everyone would die but you ll do something about that right illya where are you i ve come to get you our precious precious princess the other one isn t here i see well it doesn t matter my first priority is to secure the grail let s return illya san ah yes you actually think you can win with something like that that joke is actually funny it seems that normal spells won t do much then i gotta thank you for making me laugh against the power of the divine spirit you re using a normal human cannot win son of a if it s divine power you re using then this heroic spirit this berserker can fight back very interesting then let s see how long you can keep this up please be careful miyu sama this power can t be used for long battles indeed you can undoubtedly say that this one has comparable strength however let s see you withstand this one i know all about it that card was mine to use the greatest hero in greek mythology heracles its capabilities were amazing yes they really were until i got this card that is i overdid it a bit miyu sama are you alright yes this body seems highly durable miyu sama we ran out of time miyu sama what s that you reached your limit already then i ll do you a favor and finish this quickly trace on miyu you okay kuro onii chan we ll buy you time run miyu well this just got much more fun like hell i ll let her escape the seven rings that cover the burning heavens how long can your body hol hey you onii chan interesting i ll crush you both in one strike displacement magecraft julian return be thankful your lives were just saved you bastards looks like she s gone for now yeah miyu kuro shirou san are you alright i m fine me too somehow i m alright too i m not injured thank goodness you re all okay illya san i m here too oh so you re here ruby isn t that response a little too cruel of course not ruby i m so glad you re safe as well yes what about you illya did something happen illya actually when i went after tanaka san to the school i met erika she wants to die julian s little sister said something like that for a wish like that she speaks as if it s not something she can do herself i didn t understand what she was saying either did she mention anything else kill me if you want to save me open it and kill me by open it you mean i don t know not very reliable are you but i didn t understand a word she was saying now that i think about it back then i just need to do my best to open the pithos is what erika said did she say anything else seomthing else well gilgamesh called her the mud doll of calamity rin san luvia san a black box floating over the skies that was called a pithos erika being called the mud doll of calamity and a box that contains the hope to save the world there s at least a possibility indeed what have you been talking about you ve heard of pandora right yes of course i know a bit about her too then if pandora became a heroic spirit what would her noble phantasm be it has to be that right pandora s box that s correct opening the box out of curiosity all evil and despair came flying out and when she shut the lid the only thing that still remained in the box is hope elpis in doing so the box became a better holy grail than the holy grail itself if it s a wishing device made by deities from the age of gods then if it was made by the gods then it may be able to grant any wish no matter how big there s no way such a ridiculous noble phantasm exists seems like you ve realized it we ve witnessed that noble phantasm ourselves and we know how it ll be used it s exactly the power the ainsworths desired could it be that s right the ainsworths pulled pandora s box from the past via the card and they re making erika use it but in that case why is the box spewing all of that corrupted mud if they re opening it there should only be hope in there right that s the strange part yeah sorry i didn t want to interrupt what you were discussing but what s pandora s box i don t know either right i guess some people wouldn t know padnora was a maiden created by the gods and uh no i know who pandora is she s from greek myth correct what i don t know is just pandora s box you don t know such a famous story even though you know about pandora herself yeah all i know from the greek myths books i ve read is that pandora is a human created by the gods what do you mean knowing just that part is strange they know about pandora but not about pandora s box but that means it can t be what came out of the box mud and heroic spirits are more suitable to be called despair if the thing that s in the box isn t hope but despair then in this world pandora s box was never opened who allowed you to act on your own you re not good at treating ladies huh leave where did you go i went for a walk to school why who knows if i had to come up with a reason then it d be for the same reason why you still wear your school uniform how does that sound listen i ll open the pithos for sure so you so you shouldn t try and do anything foolish erika soon soon my legend will be complete death and rebirth you and i shall write a new chapter in human history in this world pandora s box wasn t opened so julian s objective is to open pandora s box if this hypothesis is correct that is that s absurd what will happen if that s the case what came out of that box was called despair if something like that is opened in this era and that s without factoring the power it s been accumulating for so many years i don t even want to think what would happen if it were to open now no way why would julian want to do something like that to save the world is what he said but to unleash such despair for that the ainsworth s wish is the salvation of mankind however saving the entirety of mankind is not an easy wish so in short to save humanity sacrifices must be made is that what you re saying yes what s with that ridiculous reasoning but i can t say i don t understand in fact speaking as a mage i would say they made the correct decision agreed how because this world will end if nothing is done about it and so in order to save humanity if it s necessary to make sacrifices it s still a better option than allowing complete extinction that s no you re wrong sacrificing someone to save someone else i wish for everyone to be happy that s right yeah illya is always like this like what then it s decided that we ll stop julain indeed in that case our next agenda would be our plan from now on to find out the things we can actually do here and i want to confirm what we absolutely cannot do as well this means it s tanaka s turn right yes yes now please be quiet over there the way tanaka is being treated is so cruel i don t wanna be quiet so if anyone has something to say um then there s something i want to request i don t want shirou san to fight anymore whate are you talking about i can still i second that as well so long i m by your side i won t allow you to engage in any life threatening battles you must be aware of it by now the more you use that heroic spirit s power the more it ll consume your body if this goes on you won t be yourself anymore but onii chan you know i experienced lots of things in the other world i didn t know of many things so i failed a lot of times too i realize now that i ve made it here with the help of many different kinds of people even for someone like myself for the first time i m finally thinking about protecting someone in my life now i know things like how much onii chan wants to protect me and also about how hard it is for you to do so because you became my onii chan i finally became who i am that s why it s my turn now i understand ok next about the battle strategy against beatrice do you have a plan in mind yes let s talk about that card sorry for waking you up i m going to the toilet i see can t sleep or is it that you don t have a sleep function if you order me to sleep i shall sleep at once angelica you really became like a doll there s no more need to perform so even that anger was fake what a shame your enraged face was the spitting image of his truly truly the same that s how i realized you re julian s older sister right so you found out magecraft is passed down through the bloodline there s no way someone this skilled in spacial displacement wouldn t be an ainsworth however you re no longer human i m a doll a doll harboring someone s consciousness that cannot return to their body every single one of the dolls i fought was broken amorality from muddled memories rampaging wile ignoring injuries deteriorated language capabilities the state you re in is instead something like a loss of emotions yes in my case more than 90 of my emotions were lost i ve learned to imitate human like emotions but in the end it s all fake there s no value to a doll s contents it can t be so eavesdropping is your hobby um this is no it s okay you have the right to listen you said you would save the world miyu and all people in this world if so then you don t know the secret that the ainsworths are hiding a thickly coated fabrication hey just who is darius julian s true father was a man named zachary i was told then who is darius darius sama is the allfather of the ainsworth as succession every ainsworth heir is replaced by darius ainsworth himself that s the ainsworth family s continuous tradition hailing from the first generation by darius julian will the advertised goal is world salvation however no one knows the true wish of darius sama who has lived for a thousand years that s why while his consciousness still remains julian is trying to grant a wish not for darius s sake but for that child s angelica san please i beg of you save my little brother well i don t know it s enormous in any case be careful if anything happens report it regardless of how insignificant it is yes has any of them shown up yet we may have lost the initiative here even so we ll still do everything we can yup yup you lot are the useless dolls that can t contribute in the battlefield we re counting on you to at least provide phone technical support no matter what the situation is this stick continues to spite us is the video feed alright luvia sama the signal is perfect sapphire using the stick as a type of long communication device i see it doesn t lose to modern machines huh rin san over there when did she first let s have a shot ready for the opening firework mj lnir all crushing hammer of the thunder god kuro bazett san we weren t hit so you showed up beatrice i missed on purpose it d be boring if it all ended on the first strike anyways illya miyu engage her as planned wait there s something behind beatrice stairs no a bridge that s julian it s starting erika right here and now end my legend this is bad the mud is if this goes on they ll come out again kuro miyu you go on ahead first huh then what about you i ll stay here to stop beatrice if so let s face her together then we ll never make it in time i agree as well the only one who can win against something like that is illyasviel that much we ve agreed on before but you don t need to worry it s hard to call it perfect but there are sufficient countermeasures illyasviel and i will take care of her take care of me huh the brat who kept running away from me and some muscle lady will take care of me for taking such an unfunny joke so far i can t help but end up laughing go don t lose illya finish her up quickly and catch up with us struggle all you want that s what our role is supposed to be after all come and face me you worthless trash beatrice what are you fighting for i want to know the truth i m here to find out not to fight nonsense i m just fighting for julian sama that s my reason i don t need any other one they let us through too easily i guess that means we ll be facing someone else kuro in front of you this sword yes okay i understand there s no problem of course just what are you talking about senpai how could i refuse a request from you leave it to me i do have a little bit of confidence with kitchen cutlery after all you these two i just have to cook them both right matou sakura they came into contact with the enemy how s it going over there they re both doing their best but it s not looking good and to think this has just started things going according to plan won t be easy it seems the one she ll use is the berserker card due to its disadvantage of gradual loss of sanity for the user we ve added an automatically activated code after 10 minutes it ll forcibly be ejected we ve created the strategy and have a good idea of where the weak spots are time is the most critical aspect illya yes we don t have any other choice but to use it the one angelica told us about berserker s special feature overwrite installing another card on top is allowed and in doing so the new card will inherit the class this unpleasant feeling is if a hero won t do a monster will i ve gotten a new kitchen knife again don t hold back grab as much as you want sakura since you re a wraith and i m a living spirit i ll save you oh crap i ll gut you that was close i was at my limit there on holding my breath i mean what did you do what did you do to me even if you re a heroic spirit who can take control of any weapon you can t take away poison oh interesting i m going to crush you you snake piece of shit bazett san don t think you can stop me with something like that are you serious ruby take this mj lnir i won t let you aiming for my right arm don t look down on me what a person shooting her own lighting at herself it s melting my mind is melting away what are you fighting for do not invade my mind illya you don t have much time before the forced ejection hurry up and follow the plan yes i ll take you down right now fourth step damn you fifth step seventh step just one remaining she did it that s nine steps backwards according to the myth after thor got poisoned by the serpent he walked nine steps backwards and fell dead if we reenact that myth then surely my divine core is telling me don t retreat don t stop push forward retreat is unforgivable just go forward that s what my father is telling me her father no effect the plan failed illya san no running away the real mj lnir and what she said about her father that can t be but that means this heroic spirit is thor had two sons who inherited mj lnir among the two there was only one whose strength rivaled gods the half god half giant magni now enough playing around time to die you re okay with that right no you can t not yet poison how filthy filthy filthy filthy i have to clean it up they were deflected but they weren t stolen now i can pin her down crap this thing is my worst enemy kuro lovely i wish senpai could see this before they die out these falling cherry blossoms the spot that was hit just now the poison was absorbed from it what in the world is she well to put it simply we need to defeat her without touching those things if that s the case the only way to break through is assassin uninclude i ll use a magical energy canon that s the only way i guess using high density output to force a way in is a magical girl specialty that s right you re senpai s little sister right now i remember i was told that only you shouldn t be killed but it s great isn t it little sisters are always cared for by older brothers siblings are a wonderful thing so jealous so envious cutting one or two arms and legs off should be fine right i wish i got to know you earlier if we did i m sure we could ve been friends no problem maximal schneiden thanks miyu with this the path is clear even this copy of mine can still cut a heroic spirit binding oh no this dagger to me is a death sentence you re okay with that right no don t this isn t over yet i still haven t saved you yet you stubborn little i m sorry illyasviel your wish can t come true beatrice is beyond saving mj lnir roaring storm of the thunder god answerer stop it bazett san fragarach that which comes later cuts first what would illya have done illya who s kinder and stronger than anyone else could probably save sakura san as well i am sorry g e bolg barbed spear that pierces with death it missed impossible wait this person doesn t even have a heart no it hurts it hurts senpai save me please save me enemy down it s fine to put it this way right maybe but we shouldn t let our guard down what s that isn t that where illya is fighting we ll go first then kuro wait is it okay to leave them it s fine i see that s right illya will save everyone hey julian kun if it s for your sake i wouldn t mind dying a second time is this love i wonder what is happening most likely the heroic spirit magni had thor s divine core that s the one my attack hit in other words magni always had two divine cores if we stay put we win this why although she escaped death she lost the authority to wield mj lnir and be thor and expectedly lost control since that s the case we only need to wait until she self destructs wait for her self destruction tears what was with that vision you saw it too bazett san again it it some kind of mental interference attack no it s not that s not an attack that lightning is beatrice s memories illyasviel illya san i can t just sit here and wait if that lightning is memories then by the end there will be no memory left of her what are you fighting for i m just fighting for julian sama those words really came from beatrice s heart she really did fight just for that reason and now she will lose even that one purpose no don t please not yet just give me a little more strength berserker julian kun julian kun julian kun this may be the last chance do you have something you want to say julian kun i what at that time i what was i trying to say again damn it damn it julian kun it s fine already shut up if you want to give up keep that to yourself i don t care about you giving up i m going to pull you out of there and get you into a hospital as fast as possible julian kun i really loved it was the same thing the same thing i wanted to say then that i loved you so much your feelings don t let them fade again that s why good night julian kun i can t believe she had something like forced card ejection applied to me really it makes me angry why are you the one crying because you saw it didn t you the moment of my death and the most important thing i forgot when a human s concept is displaced they ll for sure lose something be it intellect one of the senses or emotions what it s julian kun right what i lost was my memory what happened and when i look at you why do i not feel anything my love for julian kun tell me again what are you fighting for you know you re way too good at hitting right where it hurts even though you know why you re still going to ask that s right it was a lie when i said it was for julian kun s sake there was no trace of the feelings i had for him five years ago all gone i never had a reason to fight from the start because i m a disposable hollow doll that too is a lie right julian kun i what is it no it s nothing in the end i couldn t say it because i didn t believe in it because i didn t believe whether my feelings were real i know you lost your love even so over the next few years you came to love that same person once again i see so you lost beatrice please hurry illya san miyu san and kuro san will soon be in contact with julian illya can you hear me illya rin san thank goodness you sound like you re safe i got worried when the connection broke what s happening over there what happened with beatrice we won what julian and the ainsworths are fighting for we still don t know the real reason that s why i want to talk with him maybe i can find a way to end this battle without fighting that s much too naive illyasviel that kind of mentality won t that s certainly true but illya has overcame many predicaments with that naivety you are free to act as you wish thank you rin san but make sure you re prepared make sure you don t lose sight of what is truly important to save something you must sacrifice something there will surely come a time when you ll need to make that rin san even so i what will you do nothing nothing has changed you just go watch them what needs to be done remains the same same as back then in a few days father will be completely replaced by darious sama apparently it still hasn t sunken in for me yet emilia nee san you seem discontent not really it s just i still have never succeeded at this yet at least if i succeeded to do it i wanted father to see it well not like it matters but you still don t plan on giving up right that part of you is very similar to him i m not the next head of the family and i don t have the talent for magecraft either but i think it s better this way even if i m incompetent even if there s no meaning it it i can continue to grow through my own efforts it s alright julian even if zachary is gone i ll watch over you i ll still remember you even if father is gone and it happens to angelica nee san as well one day i ll be fine as long as emilia nee san is here please keep watching over me from now on as well i did it i did it i did it sister i can do it too that s right even someone incompetent will improve as long as you keep working on it move forward one step at a time and keep going emillia nee san emillia nee san kill me damn it where are miyu and kuro let me hear your story the ainsworths darius wish is world salvation but i think your wish is different that s what i came hear the reason why you re fighting so hard for you little brat you don t need to know about that i see you don t want to talk about it after all it should be the most important thing in the world for you even if there was some way to save both the world and miyu that s all you ll be able to save you want to to save erika chan this is too funny this isn t funny darius such a masterpiece of a joke what childish comprehension i can t stop laughing this isn t funny that s just a hopelessly unfunny joke illyasviel for erika s sake to protect erika you say your delusions are so childish that it makes me want to throw up what are you talking about more than anything i treasure erika more than anything in the world did she look like that kind of girl to you did you see her as a pitiful child unable to escape destiny that s why my wish is just one thing my wish is just one thing to protect erika to kill erika that is the only reason i fight miyu wake up miyu sama kuro sapphire what in the world happened well i m the one who wants to ask about that what is is this place you have lost erika i welcome you both this is the world that is nowhere let s take it easy in here until they finish their talk outside okay kuro ouch i m shocked onee chan what is happening to you you re not like the erika i know what do you even know about me onee chan you were the one who said i m not your friend right that was it s fine everything was a lie anyway those times even right now we ve always lied to each other which is why i want to disappear you and i the sides we stand on conflict too much to be able to say we re friends but even so please tell me the reason of your suffering yeah okay i ll tell you all about it i am your true goal is to kill her erika chan is your little sister and yet who said that erika is my little sister there was no blood relationship from the beginning and the name erika is just an alias her true name is yes emilia emilia no wait wasn t that just the name before wait i remember i remember everything what are you talking about what oh that s right as if i d ever forget the original woman the one who was always with me a gift from the gods her original name is my true name is pandora 6 000 years ago the pithos was made by the gods to avert the destruction of mankind and the gods created a mud doll as the key to open it and now having left that role unfulfilled i m a debt from the age of gods that ended up living to the present day as a guarantee my death was made by the gods to be sealed within the pithos and the pithos will never open until destruction comes this is who i am the story of pandora that will never end until i die now onee chan will you be my friend then does that mean that erika chan has lived from 6 000 years ago until now that s imp impossible yeah i wonder how many tens of thousands of times has she been bombareded with those words be careful illya san the pithos can be opened when humanity is on the brink of destruction it s now or never however having lived 6 000 year pandora s function as a key has been destroyed that s why i will open it myself using the holy grail which will you choose illyasviel will you open it or will you not it s been about 2 000 years since i ve been given that look this is why i hate humans so basically your grand plan is collective suicide sounds like a pain what don t let her sway you miyu no matter what her circumstances are it doesn t matter no matter what your reason is none of it is a good enough reason to sacrifice miyu kuro don t ever forget miyu even if the entire world were to turn on us even if you were to give up on yourself we re not giving up on the future onii chan wished for you erika no pandora you re still lying lying you say saving humanity letting pandora die opening the box these aren t lies in themselves but they aren t the truth either what s your damn point you must ve suffered for a long time i can t even imagine how much pain you ve been in that is why your wish of wanting to just die after having lived 6 000 years is a facade a facade a facade you say don t screw with me what would you know i ll open the pithos and kill pandora that s her wish and the only way to prevent humanity s destruction this is the only path if your wish to kill pandora truly came from the bottom of your heart then why are you making that face my face the anguish of an endless life i get why you would wish for death but even so that s surely wrong what s so wrong about it why are you saying such a thing because i know someone who still wished for the future despite the despair of losing everything he lost was hurt and was beaten down but that person still smiled even though his heart and body were a wreck he was still able to wish for the happiness of someone else people posses that kind of strength you ll be wishing upon me the holy grail right then stop lying i won t grant a fake wish like yours shut up shut up truth lies i couldn t care less for those things i will open the pithos you all are really always lying aren t you if you say it doesn t matter then where s your anger coming from you wished right for your dreams for your ideals you can t forgive yourself for giving those up i won t give up on anything anymore and i won t lose to a liar like you nonsense you borrowed the power of the cards you borrowed the power of that stick even the reason you fight is borrowed don t intrude on my legend you lowly extra your role ends here it s as you say all of my power is borrowed the card s power and ruby s power and all the people i ve met until now it s thanks to everyone s power i ve borrowed that i m here right right now ah it s those eye the eyes of a dreaming child i despise them why there s no reason for you to be putting your life on the line like this and yet why are you going so far to if there was someone right in front of you who only you can save what would you do what even if you ask why or for what i can t put my reason into words very well still i ll reach out my hand if there s someone suffering right in front of me you kill her that s enough just kill her already julian i don t know why but those words were horribly unpleasant yeah i agree that s the first time we ve seen eye to eye darius annoying you re so annoying i can t stand playing along with you anymore what is that thing impossible those thorns are julian s magic circuits expanded outwards the source of his magical energy is from absorbing an endless amount of magical energy like a planet blackness my world is entirely pitch black i ll kill you i ll kill pandora and then i ll dissappear no matter what you say you can t change the plot anymore i ll crush you illyasviel and yet why the ainsworths really can t stop lying in that case i ll be the one to say it on behalf of all of you why why is she i ll kill is i don t want to kill i want to die means i want to live so dazzling be gone be gone be gone and disappear forever illyasviel bellerophon bridle of chivalry we re going to lose at this rate overwrite install berserker in that case that s padnora s box a counterfeit of the world created by the gods of olympus that is the blade that will pierce you damn it stay away good grief despite this being such an important time you still can t do it just like that time so that s what all the fuss was about father no darius sama what are you doing the tool she used this time is why why did she i see it looks like you tried making a promise for the future good grief children can be so cruel you shouldn t do that to emilia considering she can t grow or die i i was just nee san kill me even though i want to die even though it hurts so much i can t die i beg of you kill me a shell made of thorns it s just like your heart uninstall i m going to destroy it because i know beatrice s angelica s shirou san s and everyone s wishes and for your wish too my wish at that time how did i answer her please kill me no i will never let you meet your end with a look like that on your face that s right my wish was not to kill nee san all i wanted was for her to smile it s just too awful that after living for 6 000 years begging for death is all you have left you ve been suffering all this time right it s been painful right so much that all you can think about now is wanting to die but that s all the more reason one day for sure i ll find a way to let you die so so please don t cry nee san that s right that s right i don t want die i want to keep living ah but it wasn t a bad life is what i wished she d say while smiling yeah i m sure of it now you re just like shirou san drivel from a child you and emiya are just children chasing ideals while being selfish and stubborn just children that s why that s why i was defeated she had the eyes i did back then that of a child wait what s happening this it can t be this must be illya pandora we re heading to the outside although world and people too only add to my wounds even so you have to face forward after all it s people who ought to heal their own wounds this is i was wondering where that mysterious space was but it was inside the box kuro miyu illya it s over isn t it yeah it s over pandora you were too greedy to try using two grails that s right you said your goal was to open the box but one holy grail would ve been enough yet you desired for both miyu and illya why look around you the contents of the pithos is rotten mud a whole planet s worth of ruined possibilites if i open the pithos then pandora can die but the mud will not stop until it covers the entire planet that s why i needed one grail to open the pithos and another one to destroy it oh right i can t let this be the last view she sees pandora s last one without sorrow one where she must be at peace i just wanted to show her that i and the world will be okay and the future no use huh i m always one step short from reaching it i know that you ll always keep going one step at a time i was so happy that you ve been working so hard over the last 10 years for my sake you re the second person who s tried to open the pithos in earnest it might have felt like it was just a blink on an eye but i m glad to have spent it with you good night big brother good night big sister what what it s a shame but this isn t the end of the story illya san the ending starts now no no i got tired of waiting around but this doesn t change anything nothing has changed at all my concept replacement is now complete now then let us finish this holy grail war kuro support us and become vip member to remove all ads from www opensubtitles org \"\n        ],\n

young man what does muhammad say umm they are god s words not his which god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black

up hit me back if you dare i affirm my nephew s religion and i say what he says whoever has the courage to fight fight with me muhammad when i hunt the desert at night i know god is not kept in a house who would have thought that hamza hamza above all with his wine drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is your god say it there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god oh my god ammar your father and mother are the first martyrs

were less than us now there he is making his entrance to the kaaba in the name of god most gracious most merciful god gave this house to abraham to be a sacred place worship no other gods but him and cleanse his house so it was muhammad took no revenge and allowed none he declared mecca a holy place no one may shed blood or cut down a tree or kill a living thing in mecca soon all arabia was converted not only to the new worship but to the new laws manners attitudes contained in islam the prophet had lived to see his work done but now he began to feel the nearness of death one great act of his prophethood remained the setting of it s seal he called the people to him and he spoke for the last time his message of surrender to god and humanity to man oh mankind listen well i may not be with you much longer the weak among you feed them on what you eat dress them as you are dressed you will meet your god and he will call you to account for your actions let those who are present warn those who are absent you are all are descendant from adam and the best among you is he who most regards god think deeply about what i say let all your feuds be abolished you must know that every muslim is the brother of every other muslim and all muslims are brothers one of another between muslims there are no races and no tribes nor must you take anything from your brother except what is given freely do not oppress and do not be oppressed o my people i am but a man it may be that the angel of death will visit me soon and death will overtake me but i have left you a book revealed by god the quran which is light and guidance now he repeated to the people the final revelation of the quran the seal and termination not muhammad s words but god s word this day i have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour to you and i ve chosen for you islam as your religion on june the 8th 632 in his 63rd year muhammad died many of his followers could not believe the fact how can such a man die but abu bakr the prophet s friend stood up in the mosque if anyone worships muhammad let him know that muhammad is dead but he who worships god let him know that god is alive and can not die they buried muhammad beside his mosque in medina but the religion he preached found it s place in the heart of man it endured it multiplied still to mecca they come mankind the people of islam dressed in their pilgrim white all equal before god all united in this place of prayer each individual soul joined in a community of worship one god synced by jisin', 'promised paradise how much

scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one', 'they change us more than we do them their depravity infects us look around here your

were less than us now there he is making his entrance to the kaaba in the name of god most gracious most merciful god gave this house to abraham to be a sacred place worship no other gods but him and cleanse his house so it was muhammad took no revenge and allowed none he declared mecca a holy place no one may shed blood or cut down a tree or kill a living thing in mecca soon all arabia was converted not only to the new worship but to the new laws manners attitudes contained in islam the prophet had lived to see his work done but now he began to feel the nearness of death one great act of his prophethood remained the setting of it s seal he called the people to him and he spoke for the last time his message of surrender to god and humanity to man oh mankind listen well i may not be with you much longer the weak among you feed them on what you eat dress them as you are dressed you will meet your god and he will call you to account for your actions let those who are present warn those who are absent you are all are descendant from adam and the best among you is he who most regards god think deeply about what i say let all your feuds be abolished you must know that every muslim is the brother of every other muslim and all muslims are brothers one of another between muslims there are no races and no tribes nor must you take anything from your brother except what is given freely do not oppress and do not be oppressed o my people i am but a man it may be that the angel of death will visit me soon and death will overtake me but i have left you a book revealed by god the quran which is light and guidance now he repeated to the people the final revelation of the quran the seal and termination not muhammad s words but god s word this day i have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour to you and i ve chosen for you islam as your religion on june the 8th 632 in his 63rd year muhammad died many of his followers could not believe the fact how can such a man die but abu bakr the prophet s friend stood up in the mosque if anyone worships muhammad let him know that muhammad is dead but he who worships god let him know that god is alive and can not die they buried muhammad beside his mosque in medina but the religion he preached found it s place in the heart of man it endured it multiplied still to mecca they come mankind the people of islam dressed in their pilgrim white all equal before god all united in this place of prayer each individual soul joined in a community of worship one god synced by jisin', 'promised paradise how much are you men prepared to suffer the prophet has said we must leave mecca if you stay they will kill you one by one muhammad says that in abyssinia there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we buy and sell in good faith we cannot afford scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one', 'they change us more than we do them their depravity infects us look around here your
